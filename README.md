# Virtual-File-System

This repo contains a class project (2015) in Java. The goal of this project is to develop a single-file Virtual File System (VFS) in Java. A VFS is usually built on top of a host file system, and it enables access to files located in different host file systems in a uniformed way. A single-file VFS could also be used as a manageable container with the functionality of a concrete file system through the usage of software. Typical applications of a single-file VFS include virtual machines, emulators, encryption (providing a FS with encrypted data).
